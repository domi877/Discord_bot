# Discord Bot
This is my first attempt to make a Discord Bot.

## Install
To use this repository you should already have created a Discord Bot and got it on your Server. Otherwise following this [Tutorial](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html).

Simply check out the repository and run the following command in the root directory.
```sh
npm install
```

## Start
To start the bot just run the following command:
```sh
node index.js
```

## Usage
To get a list of all the commands from the bot, just run `!help` in Discord.
